<p>Patent rights are an important tool for gaining market share and excluding competitors. Specifically, patents are put to use through license negotiations and other enforcement measures. We place great importance on these rights and measures, and have dealt with a large number of disputes over the years. Our litigation teams have the right skills to support clients through any negotiation or dispute.</p>
<p>Every patent-related dispute should be considered from both legal and technological standpoints. When building a case, it is important for lawyers having expertise in law and patent attorneys having expertise in technology to work together. Our main role is to provide offensive or defensive arguments by determining whether there is infringement from a technical point of view and assessing patent validity.</p>
<p>In recent years we have participated in a number of cases concerning standard essential patents in the area of 3G and LTE wireless communications.</p>
<p>We also support cross-border cases by analyzing patents and searching for prior art both in and outside Japan.</p>
