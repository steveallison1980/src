<p>Patent litigation can be an effective business tool. Japanese patent infringement litigations is usually conducted quickly. The courts typically render a decision in about 1.5 years after a complaint is filed. There is no or only extremely limited discovery in Japan, so the parties are responsible for gathering their own evidence. The plaintiff has an obligation to set forth how the accused product infringes in the complaint. Consequently, the plaintiff must sufficiently understand the accused product before the litigation starts, and provide a robust case of infringement. For potential defendants, it is necessary to develop countermeasures such as non-infringement or invalidity arguments, or design-around options.</p>
<p>Japanese courts generally decide liability, i.e., infringement and/or validity, first. An invalidation trial at the JPO can proceed simultaneously with infringement litigation. It is therefore necessary for a defendant to consider whether it should initiate an invalidation trial as part of its strategy. If the court decides validity and infringement in favor of the patent owner, it proceeds to assess damages.</p>
<p>At Ohtsuka Patent Office, before the start of any litigation we can put together a strategy that includes an assessment of the likelihood of infringement being found and the validity of the patent in question. During litigation, we assume the important role of advocating the clientâ€™s infringement, validity, and damages positions. Further, if the court requests a technical tutorial, we will give one and respond to questions from the judges and the opposing party.</p>
<p>In multi-jurisdictional, cross-border litigation the assertions and evidence presented in the different jurisdictions may not necessarily be the same even when they involve the same patent family. At Ohtsuka Patent Office, we have the technical and organizational capacity to work on such litigation by coordinating with overseas teams.</p>
