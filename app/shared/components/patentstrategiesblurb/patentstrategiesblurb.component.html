<p>A patent application is a preparatory measure for deriving business from an invention. However, simply filing an application for an invention as it is conceived does not capture the full benefit of a patent. It is important to broaden the invention in consideration of a wider business strategy, and continue to review the application strategically as the examination progresses. We continually discuss these points with our clients, and provide ideas and advice as to how to achieve the best results.</p>
<p>Patent use/licensing policy must also match the business strategy of the company. Moreover, sometimes companies find that their businesses must grow into a technical field where they have few existing patents. In such cases, a strategy that includes the use of patents belonging to other companies may become necessary. We will help your company tailor your strategy using our experience and knowledge of the latest trends in intellectual property.</p>
