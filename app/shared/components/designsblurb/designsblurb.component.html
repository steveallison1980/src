<p>Japan is taking measures to harmonize its design law and practice with those of other countries and the Hague Agreement. For example, disclosure requirements have been relaxed and protectable design subject matter has been expanded with respect to, among other things, software related designs. Software has increased design flexibility. A representative success story is GUI design of mobile phones. GUI design isdesign system. an essential part of a user's experience, and can add great value to the product.</p>
<p>The scope of protection of a design is determined by the figures submitted with the application. Unlike a patent, it is not possible to correct the scope of protection. Therefore, it is essential to have a strategy at the time of application to obtain the broadest possible protection.</p>
<p>As such, we adapt our prosecution strategies to maximize protection of your designs by identifying the design elements to be claimed and, in order to achieve the most advantageous scope of protection, deciding whether it is best to pursue a whole design or a partial design, and whether to take advantage of the related design system.</p>
<p>To prosecute your designs effectively, our team also takes advantage of the insight of ex-JPO examiners, as well as personal interviews with the examiner. At Ohtsuka Patent Office, we are proud to support our client's utilization of designs in maximizing the value of their products.</p>
