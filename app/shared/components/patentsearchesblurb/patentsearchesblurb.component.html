<p>One major cause of defeat in litigation for a patent owner is invalidation of the patent based on prior art. In Japan, the courts have the power to render judgment on the validity of a patent. Claim interpretation also depends greatly on known technology, thus the role of prior art references in litigation is an important one.</p>
<p>There are many patent and non-patent publications published in Japanese. Thus Japanese prior art can play a key role in invalidating U.S. and European patents. However, because of language issues, they can be difficult to search and review.</p>
<p>At Ohtsuka Patent Office, we have extensive experience in performing prior art searches. Because our patent attorneys have technical expertise as well as bilingual skills, we are able to correctly identify what needs to be searched and where to search, and come up with a focused plan that produces more fruitful results.</p>
