<p>Smart phones and tablets are among the leading popular products of today. The brands borne by such products are renowned and instantly recognizable, and are themselves representative of the `look' of the product. Consumers frequently buy goods relying on reputation of the brand. Your brand is paramount, and must be carefully protected.</p>
<p>It is essential for a brand to match the style of the product and the business, and to be easy to remember.</p>
<p>Every company wishes to create a brand name that is simple and impressionable as a trademark, but on the other hand, there are now 5.6 million trademark registrations in Japan, so there is a chance that the desired name has already been registered. It is not easy to find a trademark that can be used safely. When selecting your trademark, careful consideration is necessary in view of similarity of trademarks and the competitive relationship with other companies.</p>
